About
-----

The goal of the Open Scholar Foundation is to improve the efficiency of
scholarly communication by providing incentives for researchers to openly
share their digital research artifacts, including manuscripts, data,
protocols, source code, and lab notes.

The proposal of an "Open Scholar Foundation" was one of the winners of the 1K
challenge of the Beyond the PDF conference: http://www.force11.org/node/4358.
This was the task of the challenge:

> What would you do with 1K that would significantly advance scholarly
> communication that does not involve building a new software tool?

The idea was to establish a committee that would certify researchers as "Open
Scholars" according to given criteria. This was the original proposal:

> I would set up a simple "Open Scholar Foundation" with a website, where
> researchers can submit proofs that they are "open scholars" by showing that
> they make their papers, data, metadata, protocols, source code, lab notes,
> etc. openly available. These requests are briefly reviewed, and if approved,
> the applicant officially becomes an "Open Scholar" and is entitled to show a
> banner "Certified Open Scholar 2013" on his/her website, presentation
> slides, etc. Additionally, there could be annual competitions to elect the
> "Open Scholar of the Year".

An alternative approach (perhaps more practical and promising) would be to
provide a scorecard for researchers to calculate their "Open Scholar Score"
on their own. This is an incomplete draft of such a scorecard:
https://github.com/tkuhn/openscholar/blob/master/docs/scorecard-draft.md

In any case, his project should lead to an established and recognized
foundation that motivates scholars to openly share their data and results.
Being a certified Open Scholar should be something that increases one's
reputation and visibility, and should give a counterweight to possible
benefits from keeping data and results secret. The criteria for Open
Scholars should become more strict over time, as the number of "open-minded"
scholars hopefully increases over the years. This should go on until,
eventually, scholarly communication has fundamentally changed and does not
require this special incentive anymore.

It is probably a good idea to use Mozilla Open Badges for these Open Scholar
banners: http://openbadges.org/
