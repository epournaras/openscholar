Idea
----

The original idea was to have a committee that would certify researchers as
"Open Scholars" according to given criteria. An alternative approach (this seems
more practical and promising) would be to provide a scorecard for researchers
to calculate their "Open Scholar Score" on their own. This is an incomplete
draft of such a scorecard:
