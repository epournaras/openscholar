<h1>Open Scholar Foundation</h1>

<p>
The proposal of an "Open Scholar Foundation" was one of the winners of the
<a href="http://www.force11.org/node/4358" target="_blank">1K challenge of the Beyond the
PDF conference</a>.
</p>

<p>
This was the task of the challenge:
</p>

<blockquote>
What would you do with 1K that would significantly advance scholarly communication that does not
involve building a new software tool?
</blockquote>

<p>
And this is the proposal:
</p>

<blockquote>
I would set up a simple "Open Scholar Foundation" with a website, where researchers can submit
proofs that they are "open scholars" by showing that they make their papers, data, metadata,
protocols, source code, lab notes, etc. openly available. These requests are briefly reviewed,
and if approved, the applicant officially becomes an "Open Scholar" and is entitled to show a
banner "Certified Open Scholar 2013" on his/her website, presentation slides, etc. Additionally,
there could be annual competitions to elect the "Open Scholar of the Year".
</blockquote>
